    Have you attended MY golang basics class? ( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1)


Quality of the Code?
    Decoupled
    Easy to change
    Reusable
    Extensible

    Open Closed Principle
        Open for extension but Closed for modification

Concurrency
    Concurrency is the ability to have more than one execution path

    Detecting data races
        go run --race <program.go>
        go build --race <program.go> // DO NOT do this for production build

    Channel
        A data type for enabling communication between goroutines

        Declaration
            var ch chan int

        Instantiation
            ch = make(chan int)

        Operations (<- operator)
            Send
                ch <- data
            Receive
                data := <-ch

        Behavior:
            A RECEIVE operation is ALWAYS a blocking operation

            A SEND operation is BLOCKED until a RECEIVE operation is initiated (Conditions apply)

Concurrency Patterns
    1. Worker
    2. Pool
        Help us Minimize (Not Restrict) the # of resources created
        Pool Size => How many object that can be maintained by the pool for reuse

        Acquire()
            Check if the resource is in the pool
                If yes, return the resource from the pool
                else
                    Get the resource from the factory and return
        Release()
            Check if the pool is empty enough to keep the resource
                If yes, keep the resource in the pool
                else
                    discard the resource

        Close()
            discard all the resources in the pool
            shutdown the pool
    3. Runner

Context
    Used for signaling across goroutines
    Hierarchy of contexts
    Can be used to share data across goroutines

    Root Context
        context.Background()

    Child Contexts
        context.WithCancel()
            - used to programmatically send a "cancel" signal

        context.WithTimeout() & context.WithDeadline()
            - automatically send "cancel" signal based on the time

        context.WithValue()
            - used to share data across hierarchy of contexts

gRPC
    Native RPC
        - .NET remoting
        - Java RMI
        
        Advantages
            - Serialize the data in binary format (very less payload size when compared to JSON & XML)
            - Realtime updates

    protocol buffers
        - serialization mechanism

    Supported Communication Patterns
        - Request & Response
        - Server Streaming (One Request & Multiple responses)
        - Client Streaming (Multiple Requests & One Response)
        - Bidirectional Streaming (Multiple Requests & Multiple Responses)

    How?
        Define Schema (using protocol buffers)
            Service Contract
            Operation Contract
            Data Contract (Message Contract)
        
        Generate Proxy & Stub
            protoc --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative --go-grpc_out=. --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative proto/service.proto

            service.pb.go
                Logic for serializing and deserializing the data (data contracts)
            service_grpc.pb.go
                Logic for Proxy & Stub


        Implement the Service
        Host the Service
        Implement the Client to communicate to the server

    Installation
        1. Protocol Buffers Compiler (protoc tool)
            Windows:
                Download the file, extract and keep in a folder (PATH) accessble through the command line
                https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v21.12/protoc-21.12-win64.zip
            Mac:
                brew install protobuf

            Verification:
                protoc --version

        2. Go plugins
            go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@v1.28
            go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@v1.2

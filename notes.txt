Quality of the Code?
    Decoupled
    Easy to change
    Reusable
    Extensible

    Open Closed Principle
        Open for extension but Closed for modification

Concurrency
    Concurrency is the ability to have more than one execution path

    Detecting data races
        go run --race <program.go>
        go build --race <program.go> // DO NOT do this for production build

    Channel
        A data type for enabling communication between goroutines

        Declaration
            var ch chan int

        Instantiation
            ch = make(chan int)

        Operations (<- operator)
            Send
                ch <- data
            Receive
                data := <-ch

        Behavior:
            A RECEIVE operation is ALWAYS a blocking operation

            A SEND operation is BLOCKED until a RECEIVE operation is initiated (Conditions apply)
